Introduction
************

This recipe can be used to generate textfiles from a (text)
template.

.. contents::

A short example::

  [buildout]
  parts = message

  [message]
  recipe = collective.recipe.template
  input = templates/message.in
  output = ${buildout:parts-directory}/etc/message

  mymessage = Hello, World!


In the template you can use the exact same variables as you can use
in the buildout configuration. For example an input file can look like this::

  My top level directory is ${buildout:directory}
  Executables are stored in ${buildout:bin-directory}


As an extension to the buildout syntax you can reference variables from
the current buildout part directly. For example::

  My message is: ${mymessage}


Features
========

* Starting with version 1.3, you can also specify a path to the output
  file and the path will be created if it does not exist.
* Starting with version 1.5, you can use inline templates.
* Starting with version 1.7, you can use `genshi text templates`_.
* Starting with version 1.9, you can use a URL to specify template input.
* Starting with version 1.12, you can specify ``timeout`` as an option to
  configure ``urllib2`` requests.
* Starting with version 2.1, you can set ``input-encoding`` and
  ``output-encoding`` to specify the character encoding.

Genshi text templates
---------------------

A short example::

  [buildout]
  parts = message

  [message]
  recipe = collective.recipe.template[genshi]:genshi
  input = templates/message.in
  output = ${buildout:parts-directory}/etc/message
  some-option = value

  mymessage = Hello, World!

In the template you can use the exact same variables as you can use
in the buildout configuration, but instead of colons as the separator you
either have to use attribute access, or for options with a dash dictionary
syntax. The global buildout config is accessible through ``parts``, the
current part through ``options``.

For example an input file can look like this::

  My top level directory is ${parts.buildout.directory}
  Executables are stored in ${parts.buildout['bin-directory']}
  Accessing the current part: ${options['some-option']}


Why another template recipe?
============================

Both `iw.recipe.template`_ and `inquant.recipe.textfile`_ claim to do the
same thing. I have found them to be undocumented and too buggy for real
world use, and neither are in a public repository where I could fix them. In
addition this implementation leverages the buildout variable substitution
code, making it a lot simpler.
